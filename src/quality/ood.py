"""Out-of-distribution (OOD) scoring for DR predictions.

Combines three cheap, model-agnostic signals into a single ``ood_score``
in ``[0, 1]``:

1. **Max-softmax deficit** (``1 - max(probs)``) — flat distributions are
   the classic symptom of inputs the classifier has never seen.
2. **Normalized predictive entropy** — ``-sum(p log p) / log(K)``.
3. **Input-statistic deviation** (optional) — distance of measured
   brightness/contrast from the fundus operating envelope. A confident
   prediction on pixels far outside the envelope is suspicious.

The detector is *advisory only*: it never blocks grading. Callers append
its flags to the confidence-flags list so reviewers see them.
