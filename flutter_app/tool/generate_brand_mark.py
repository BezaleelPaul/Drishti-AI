"""Derive the ELYTRIVA mark-only asset (no navy tile) for the splash.

The shipped brand PNG is a rounded-square navy TILE (designed for the
launcher icon and for use on light surfaces). Its tile colour is exactly the
app's canvas navy (#0B132B), so the tile disappears when painted onto the
canvas — but the FLAME canvas adds a radial glow, which makes an opaque
tile read as a dark square. Removing the tile therefore keeps the artwork
floating on the glow.

HOW THE TILE IS REMOVED (and why a threshold is wrong)
------------------------------------------------------
Naively keying every "dark" pixel (max channel < 60) also deletes the
ARTWORK's own anti-aliased edge pixels — a teal stroke blended 10% into the
navy measures (13,40,59) and would be punched out, leaving notches along
the outline (the "cut border" artefact).

Instead we remove ONLY pixels that are the tile colour itself, within a
small RGB tolerance. Every artwork pixel — including the dim blends along
its outline — is preserved, so the mark keeps smooth edges.
